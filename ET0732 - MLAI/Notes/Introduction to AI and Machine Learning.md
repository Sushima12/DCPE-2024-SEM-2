#### ML Model Categories

>Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Computers mimicking human intelligence

>Machine Learning (ML)
- Subset of AI that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed
- Types of ML:
  1. Supervised Learning
  2. Unsupervised Learning
  3. Deep Learning (Deep Neural Networks) - add layers between input and output to make machine learn in depth

>Generative AI
- Produce content and perform tasks based on requests
- Relies on training extensive models
  - Large language models (Deep Learning Model)

>Supervised Learning
- Learns from labeled data
- Application:
  - Task driven, identifies a goal

>Types of Supervised Learning
1. Classification
   - Predicts Categorical Variable
   - Uses Logistic Regression
   - Example: Whether a picture shows a cat or dog
 2. Regression
    - Predicts numeric variable
    - Uses Linear Regression
    - Example: Forecasting sales for a product based on past sales
 

>Unsupervised Learning
- Learns from unlabeled data
- Finds underlying patterns
- Application
  - Data driven, identifies a pattern

>Types of Supervised Learning
1. Clustering
	- Groups data points together
	- Uses customer demographics to determine customer segmentation
	- Uses K means clustering
2. Association
	- Identifies Underlying relationships
	- Correlates 2 products to place them closer in a grocery store
	- Uses  association rule learning
3. Dimensionality Reduction
	- Reduces number of dimensions in dataset to improve efficiency  of the model
	- Combines characteristics to create a simplified rule for a insurance quote
	- uses principal component analysis

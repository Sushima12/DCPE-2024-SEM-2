#### Machine Learning Phases and Data Quality

>Phases in Machine Learning
- Training Phase
	- Model Development
- Inference Phase
	- Model deployment 
	- Predictions

>ML Project Steps
1. Define Use case and success criteria
2. Deliver ML model through manual or automated steps

>Key steps related to Data:
>`Data Extraction`
- Retrieve data from diverse sources
	- structured / unstructured
>`Data Analysis`
- Uses Exploratory Data Analysis to identify trends and anomalies
>`Data Preparation`
- Data Transformation
	- Modify format / structure
- Data Cleansing
	- Remove duplicates and irrelevant records
- Data Type Correction
	- Fix errors and convert types

>Data Quality Attributes
- Accuracy
	- Data should reflect real world events
- Timeliness
	- Measure time from capture to availability
- Completeness
	- Ensure all intended data is present

>Improving Data Quality
- Address missing values and unwanted characters
- Format date / time features
- Use One-hot Encoding for categorical features

>Iterative Process
- Data exploration and cleaning are continuous
- Data Quality thus improving over time

>Why Data quality is important
- Higher the quality, the more enhanced the predictive power of the ML Model

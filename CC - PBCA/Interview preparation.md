1. Could you tell me about a particularly challenging diploma course you've taken so far , and what you learnt form it?

1. Describe a sucessful project
	there was a module during year 2 in Polytechnic, It was Devops.
	The project was about Fire alarm system, which we had to program it in python
	The project was the first Git project, and there were challenges, such as ensuring every team member knows what to do to get the job done. There were times where we had to ensure everyone had the same git repository, otherwise, errors would occur, to deal with this issue, we installed a vscode extension called git graphs, we would remind each other to update the repository if the local repo of the team member is behind the up to date changes
	
	My role of the project was to program the manual activation of the fire alarm, and the light detection of the fire alarm
	

2. Example of a time when you demonstrated leadership skills
	It was in Secondary 3 when i was appointed as the camp coordinator in my CCA which was National Police Cadet Corp
	I had to ensure that the camp run smoothly as possible,

3. (Tell me about yourself):
	I am Boon Siong, currently a Year 3 Singapore Polytechnic Student, pursuing a Diploma in Computer Engineering. Before i was a student in SP,  i was an ITE Student, had a Higher NITEC certificate in Electrical Engineering
	
	While these 2 courses may seem unrelated, there are some similarities, for example, in ITE, there was this module called Instrumentations and Controls System, which taught me Logic gates, and it gave a stepping stone (or rather a boost) to help me understand what i learned in Digital Electronics which is a module in Poly
	
4. Work Experience
	During my Internship in SP,  I was attached to a small company that does custom built drones. my main task was to redesign the entire company website, however i wasn't that good at that time, thus i had to research on my own by reading existing Documentations for HTML, Javascript and PHP, which relates to SP's idea of being a self directed learner.

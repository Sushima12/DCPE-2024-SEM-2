#### Wireless & Cellular Communications

>Wireless Communications
- Allows  transfer of information in the air between transmitter and receiver
- uses radio frequency signals

>Radio Frequency Signals
- Electromagnetic signal which is characterized by wavelength and frequency
- Frequency range from 3KHz to 300Ghz
- Wavelengths range from 100Km to 1mm
- "Carries" Information
  - Analog Information (AM / FM) is continuous
  - Digital Information (Wireless Data) is discrete

>Radio Signal Properties

$$
Frequency = \frac{SpeedOfLight}{WaveLength}
$$

>Carrier Waves
- RF Signals used for information transfer

>Modulation
- Process of impress information on to carrier wave for transmission
  - Have to demodulate the carrier at the receiver to recover data
  - Analog and Digital Modulation can be performed based on the data to be transferred
